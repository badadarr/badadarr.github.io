# Skills Grid Removal - Documentation

## ✅ Skills Grid Component Removed

### What Was Removed
The skills grid component displayed 6 skill items (Python, Flutter, Swift, Next.js, Laravel, AI/ML) in the About section.

### Files Modified
1. **index.html**
   - Removed `<div class="skills-grid">` and all 6 skill-item elements (~50 lines)
   - Removed `.skills-grid` from JavaScript criticalElements array

2. **style/simple-layout.css**
   - Removed `.skills-grid` CSS rule (display grid, layout)
   - Removed `.skills-grid` from mobile media query
   - Removed `.skills-grid` from visibility fallback styles

### Impact
- **HTML**: Reduced by ~50 lines
- **CSS**: Reduced by ~10 lines (skills-grid rule)
- **Overall**: Cleaner About section, focus on contact info and tech stack section

### What Remains
- Contact info brief (Email, Phone)
- Tech Stack section (still has all 6 technologies in a different format)
- About text and description
- Skills are now only shown in the "Tech Stack" section below

### Visual Impact
- About section is now simpler and more focused
- Technical skills are now consolidated in the dedicated "Tech Stack" section
- Removed visual redundancy
